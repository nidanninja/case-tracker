The program will automatically load for the current day when opened. You won't need to change the date in the program unless you are going back to add errors to a previous date.


The buttons to add cases and errors will add +1 to the respective counter. If you make a mistake, you can manually select the case count and re-type a number; you cannot select and change the error count, only add +1 or reset the entire day. If the team wants this, I can change this in a future update. For now though, just make sure you're only adding to the error counter when necessary, since you'll have to manually fix the error count if you add too many.


Whenever an error on a case you entered is pointed out to you, you should first make sure that any data you currently have is exported; then use the date picker to select the date the incorrect case was entered, and add +1 error to the appropriate type of case (for example, +1 Digital error.) You must export the data for that day, by clicking the Export button, otherwise the added error will not save.


There may be some additional pop-ups when first using the program that I haven't quite figured out yet; generally, just try exporting a few times if it gives you any trouble. It should automatically create a new folder where the file is located called "CaseTracking" and will create an appropriate file for the case tracking based on the month in which it is used (for example, March's file at time of writing would be called "3-2024.csv"). If the file or folder doesn't already exist, the program will mention a few "errors" when exporting for the first time, but you can usually ignore these.


The application has a timer/stopwatch feature implemented to keep track of how many hours are spent per day on case entry only, so please start and stop this timer when you are entering cases. For example, I've been pausing this any time I pick up a phone call, stop to reply to an email, etc.


The output file is accessible any time inside the "CaseTracking" folder which will be in the same location as the program - keep in mind that the output will be saved as a ".csv" format which should be opened with Microsoft Excel, if needed. The program will also automatically calculate your error percentage and cases per hour for each day as it is exported, which can be viewed in the .csv file.


If it makes the program easier to use, there is a checkbox you can select which will force the window to stay on top of all other windows. This means that even while you're entering cases, you can still see the case tracker without having to switch back and forth. You can toggle this on or off at any time on the left side.
